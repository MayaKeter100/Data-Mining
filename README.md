# Data-Mining

### Problem Description:
Telephone marketing campaigns are one of the most effective ways to reach out to people for insurance marketing. However, they require huge investment as large call centers are hired to actually
execute these campaigns. Furthermore, the increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns over
time has reduced its effect on the general public. All of these as well as economic pressures and
competition have led marketing managers to invest in directed campaigns with a strict and rigorous
selection of contacts.
### The Goal:
The goal is to increase the efficiency of direct marketing campaigns for life insurance subscriptions
by reducing the number of contacts.
